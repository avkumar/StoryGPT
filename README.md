# StoryGPT

This is a storybook experience, that works like a choose-your-own-adventure book, built using OpenAI and StabilityAI's APIs.

----

## Note:
This model does not work without the user entering their OpenAI and Stability.AI API keys.

- For an OpenAI key, sign up at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys/.
- For a Stability.AI key, sign up at https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/account/.

----

For any bugs or feature requests, please open an issue in this repository, and I will make sure to get back to you.
If you would like to help me make this better, please let me know so I can make those changes, or open a pull request.

----

## Roadmap
- [] Use an open-source Stable Diffusion from HuggingFace Hub to replace Stability.AI's API to make this model more accessible.
- [] Use an open-source LLM to replace OpenAI's API to make StoryGPT more accessible.
